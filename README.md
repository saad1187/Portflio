## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the `id`, `class`, and `data-nav` variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.

## App
Here is where the functionality happens. There is two things that this file primarily achieves. The first is dynamically building out the navigation. We loop through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one. Finally, this file listens for clicks on the navigation and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section header.

## Running
To launch this website, simply open the `index.html` file in the browser.
